<sentence>About:</>
<sentence>I decided to make SGML the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-SGML) as SGML is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the SGML programming language. It only makes sense to SGML the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.</>
